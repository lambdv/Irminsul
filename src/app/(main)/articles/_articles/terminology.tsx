                        <div>
                            Acronym for Damage Per Second.
                            <br />
                            <p>When referring as a role, its used to describe a character&apos;s primary role as doing a noticable amount of the team damage contribution.</p>
                        </div>

                       <div>
                            <p>Refers to units that primarily deals the most damage <b>and or</b> take the most continuous field time in the team.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>Due to field time and team damage contribution not being mutually exclusive and the ambiguity between what people&apos;s own definition of the term, it is recommended to use more explicit terms such as &quot;<b>On-Field Damage Dealer</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>Off-Field Damage Dealer</b>&quot;.</p>
                       </div>

                            <p>&quot;Sub&quot; meaning &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;lesser&quot;.</p>
                            <p>Refers to units that deals a decent amount of the teams damage contribution but less than the main damage dealer or carry. Often doing so off field.</p>
                            <br />
                            <p>Again due to damage contribution and field time not being mutually exclusive and variance in damage contribution depending on other factors, it is recommended to use more explicit terms.</p>

                            <p>Unit&apos;s who has a major role is that they provides elemental application to enemies that enables some sort of reaction or interaction with other team members.</p>

                            <p>Unit&apos;s provide supportive utility by controlling enemy positioning.</p>
                            <p>Often refered to anemo units that use suction to pull enemies together (Kazuha&apos;s skill, Venti&apos;s burst). This form of CC is specifically called &quot;Grouping&quot;.</p>
                            <p>CC can also come in the form of stopping enemies from moving with the Freeze reaction or Zhongli&apos;s burst.</p>
                            <p>Taunts (Amber and Mona skill) are technically a form of CC, but are not considered due to the inefficiency of the mechanic.</p>
