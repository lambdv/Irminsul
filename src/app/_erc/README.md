# Energy Recharge Requirement Caclulation

## basicss
- character can have an amount of energy, when energy cost of burst is filled, you can use the burst
- energy is mainly gained from particles. same element particles give the most energy, different give the least and "white" particles gives a neutral amount
- particles can be generated using skills or droped from enemies
- "orbs" are special big particles that give more energy 
- catching particles directly gives more energy can being off field when particles are concumed
- particles are divided equally among off field characters, less characters in the part, the more energy each character will recive (due to portion size)
- energy gained from particles is increaced by mutlplying the energy recharge stat.

- flat energy is another way of giving energy. they are not effected by energy recharge stat. flat energy can be gained from passives or a chance when normal attacking enemies


energy recharge requirement of a character at a high level is based on
